# Iains CV Jekyll Theme

I'm hosting my website on git! iainbenson.com pointing to these pages.

Iains CV Jekyll Theme is a free responsive Jekyll theme, forked from  [personal-jekyll-theme](https://panossakkos.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/).  I've updated add my personal info in and to remove the centre justification which I didn't much like and probably one or two other bit'n'bobs.

Notes from the original theme that could be useful:

## How to run locally

First, you need to install jekyll and the dependencies of { Personal } by running:

```shell
./scripts/install
```

Then, you can build and serve your website by simply running:

```shell
./scripts/serve-production
```

To serve across lan (requires su to forward the port 4000 over lan):

```shell
./scripts/serve-lan-production
```

## OSS used in { Personal }

One of the reasons { Personal } is real is the following OSS projects:

  1. [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)
  2. [hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/)
  3. [highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/)
  4. [RRSSB](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb)
  5. [Timeline](https://github.com/kirbyt/timeline-jekyll-theme)
  6. [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
