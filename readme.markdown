## Customizing your website from the config

Even if you have no experience with Jekyll you can personalize your website from the config file (_config.yml). This section describes the variables and how they change the content of your website.

## Posting a new post

Jekyll is waiting for new posts to show up as a file under _/posts with a file name "YYYY-MM-DD-title.markup". Also your file's content should start like this

```
---
layout: post
title: <Post's title>
category: <Post's category>
---
```

And after this header you can write your post using Markdown.
## Steps forward
