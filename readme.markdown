## Customizing your website from the config

Even if you have no experience with Jekyll you can personalize your website from the config file (_config.yml). This section describes the variables and how they change the content of your website.

### Favicon
````
favicon: "/img/favicon.ico"
````
Points to the website's favicon. You can either change the path to the desired favicon or replace the actual file.

### Black Favicon
````
black-favicon: "/img/black-lab-glass.ico"
````
Before the title of website a black and white version of the favicon appears. This value is the path to this image file.

### Google Analytics
````
google-tracking-id: "UA-35880426-3"
````
Place the id of your tracking code here and the code will be autogenerated and included in every page. If you don't want analytics, just remove the string value and the code will not be generated.

### Disqus
````
disqus-shortname: "panossakkos"
````
Add your Disqus username to enable Disqus comments. When this value is set then every post will get the comments below the post and the comments counters in the post preview of the home page and the Archive. Remove the value if you don't want the Disqus functionality.

### Navigation Bar links
This variable is usefull only if you want to add more pages and not be included in the navigation bar. It included the pages that you want to include in the navigation bar.
````
pages_list:
  About: 'about'
  Blog: 'blog'
  Career: 'career'
  Contact: 'contact'
````

### Background image
````
background-img: "/img/intro-bg.jpg"
````
Set the variable to the image that you want to be displayed in the index page.

### Me image
Set the variable to the desired image of you that you want to be displayed in the index page. This image when clicked, it scrolls down to the About section.
````
me-img: "/img/me.jpg"
````

### Post preview size
This variable dicates how many words do you want to display as preview in the Blog section of the home page.
````
post-preview-words: 128
````

For all the variables that contain image paths, you can either change them to point to the new images, or replace the image files.

## Posting a new post

Jekyll is waiting for new posts to show up as a file under _/posts with a file name "YYYY-MM-DD-title.markup". Also your file's content should start like this:

```
---
layout: post
title: <Post's title>
category: <Post's category>
---
```

After this header you can start writing your post using Markdown.

## Steps forward
* Support discovery with support of tags
* 404 page
