## About

My story begins when I have moved in London in Semptember 2006. In that year I was enrolled to M.Eng degree in Civil Engineering and Mathematical Science. The aim was to learn how things and systems work. Once I have graduated with a first class honors degree from City University, my interest was shifted in understanding the ideas of managing a project and also to sustain a financial leverage for this project. These two concepts could guarantee a successful project delivery, which the latter could be a solution to a problem. <br/> My next checkpoint was therefore the UCL Bartlett School where I have attended the M.Sc. course in Construction economics and Management. There I have learn how to manage the financial point of a project but also the importance of system engineering and why the human factor should always be a part of a design solution. <br/>  My professional career was launched on 2013/14 when I have joined Aibel UK ltd. A company in the energy sector providing structural solutions for offshore steel framed platforms. Then, I have joined Mott Macdonald community because I was in line with the company values in sustainable development and social rensponsibility. <br/> My aspiration is always to challenge the way we work and how we can use any skills people have so we can add value in our communities. Thoughout my journey I would be very happy to find people with the same aspirations so we can discuss, exchange ideas and also provide with solutions that could have an impact to the "system" that we are living. <br/> Understanding the nature of a problem and create a sustainable system that will provide with an efficient outcome is a fascinating process. 

Thank you,
