Hello! My name is Iain Benson and this is my personal site detailing my work history.  The site also has a blog
where I may ramble on about stuff that is of interest to me such as [software development](categories/dev.html), 
[Linux](categories/linux.html), and how best to go about [losing money](categories/investment.html) on the stock 
exchange.  As you can no doubt tell, I'm a great laugh to be around at parties.

I graduated in 1996 from Glasgow University with a 1st class degree in Physics. I now work as a programmer, 
with over 15 years of professional experience (and many more if typing programs out of 
[Sinclair User](https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine) counts).  My work roles have ranged from 
programming radar modes for the new Eurofighter Typhoon, to developing accounting software used by fund managers.
