## About

Hello! My name is Iain Benson and this is my personal site where I hope to detail by work history and possible blog about stuff that is of interest to me.

I have had a passion for computing for many years, working in industry as a computer programmer for over 15 years.  I graduated in 1996 from Glasgow University with a 1st class degree in Physics. My work roles have ranged from programming radar modes for the new Eurofighter Typhoon, to developing accounting software used by fund managers in the City of London.

If you are interested in hiring me then please do get in touch.
