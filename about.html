## About

Hi,

I have moved in London in Semptember 2006 in order to complete an M.Eng degree in Civil Engineering and Mathematical Science. Once I have graduated with a first class honors degree from City University, my interest was shifted in understanding the ideas of managing your project and also to sustain financial leverage for your project. These two concepts could guarantee a successful project delivery. My next checkpoint was therefore the UCL Bartlett School where I have attended the M.Sc. course in Construction economics and Management. My professional career was launched on year 2013/14 when I have joined Aibel UK ltd. A company in the energy sector providing structural solutions for offshore steel framed platforms. Then, I have joined Mott Macdonald community because i was in line with the company values in sustainable development and social rensponsibility. Understanding the nature of a problem and create a sustainable system that will provide with an efficient outcome is a fascinating process. 

Thank you, London 2016
