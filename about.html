Hello! My name is Iain Benson and this is my personal site detailing my work history.  I graduated in 1996 
from Glasgow University with a 1st class degree in Physics. I work as a programmer, with over 20 years 
of professional experience.  My work roles have ranged from programming radar modes for the new Eurofighter 
Typhoon, to developing accounting software used by fund managers.
