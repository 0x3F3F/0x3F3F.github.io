Hello! My name is Iain Benson and this is my personal site detailing my work history and random stuff 
that intersts me.  I graduated in 1996 from Glasgow University with a 1st class degree in Physics. I've 
worked as a programmer, with over 20 years of professional experience.  My work roles have ranged from 
programming radar modes for the Eurofighter Typhoon, to developing accounting software used by fund managers.
