## About

Hello! My name is Iain Benson and this is my personal site detailing my work history.  I may also blog about 
stuff that is of interest to me such as Linux, Raspberry Pi, Vim and how best to go about losing money on the 
stock exchange.  As you can no doubt tell, I'm a great laugh to be around at parties.

I graduated in 1996 from Glasgow University with a 1st class degree in Physics. I now work as a programmer, 
and have around 15 years of professional experience.  My work roles have ranged from programming radar modes 
for the new Eurofighter Typhoon, to developing accounting software used by fund managers.
