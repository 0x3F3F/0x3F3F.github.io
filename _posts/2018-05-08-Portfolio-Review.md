## Commentary

The above screenshots are taken from my tracking spreadsheet and are intended to give a
rough idea of the thought process behind my portfolio construction.

The portfolio itself is under construction and holdings will be drip fed into it over a
period of time.  This could be years, or more quickly in the event of a bear market.  Due
to it's nature, the Multi Asset portfolio is more complete.

As the portfolio is not fully vested, I won't share the holdings / Investment
Themes + Rationale, though may do so at some point in the future.  

In reality, the Portfolio Review posts are for my own benefit though others may find them
of interest.  Their purpose is to allow me (on an annual basis) to track performance, and
log my thought process.
