## Commentary

The above screenshots are taken from my tracking spreadsheet and are intended to give an
idea of the high-level portfolio [Asset Allocation]({% post_url 2018-02-08-Asset-Alloc-Correlation %}) 
and the thought process behind it.

The portfolio is still under construction and holdings will be drip fed into it over a
period of time.  This could be years, or more quickly in the event of a bear market.  Due
to it's nature, the Multi Asset portfolio is more complete (I'm happier to hold this in a bear
market).

As the portfolio is in an accumulation phase, I won't share the holdings / Investment
Themes & Rationale at this time, though may do so at some point in the future.  

All portfolios are unitised, which compensates for dividends and monies in/out.  This is
important as gives a measure with which to make a like for like comparison against my comparative 
indices and allows me to accurately ascertain my performance.

In reality, these Portfolio Review posts are for my own benefit and the web site seemed a 
logical place for them, for quick future reference.  Their purpose is to allow me, on an annual 
basis, to track performance and log my thought process behind any decisions.  

I should add, as each decision is an opportunity to make a mistake, I hope not to have to make too 
many.  As a core part of the portfolio is based around taking advantage of demographic trends that 
will occur over coming decades, it makes little sense to react to short term underperformance 
that will inevitably occur at times.
