## Commentary

The above screenshots are taken from my tracking spreadsheet and are intended to give an
idea of the high level-portfolio structure and thought process behind it.

The portfolio is still under construction and holdings will be drip fed into it over a
period of time.  This could be years, or more quickly in the event of a bear market.  Due
to it's nature, the Multi Asset portfolio is more complete (I'm happier to hold this is a bear
market).

As the portfolio is in an accumulation phase, I won't share the holdings / Investment
Themes + Rationale at this time, though may do so at some point in the future.  

In reality, these Portfolio Review posts are for my own benefit and the web site seemed a 
logical place for them.  Their purpose is to allow me, on an annual basis, to track performance 
and log my thought process behind any decisions made during the year.
