Performance this year has been mixed with an increase of **+8.5%**, ahead of my`RPI+3%` (+6%) benchmark but trailing the `FTSEAS-TR` 
(9.2%).    


## Portfolio

<img style="border: 0 ; padding-bottom: 5px" src="/img/2024/2024_Holdings2.png" />

This portfolio has an anti-ESG bias, trying to take advantage of mis-pricings caused by ESG constraints eg funds 
not allowed to own tobacco/coal, transition to electric will be slower than thought (oil will be needed much longer), 
coal still essential and growing etc. There is also a bias to inflation beneficiaries - 
[asset light]({% post_url 2021-03-06-Asset-Light-Companies %}), real assets etc.

I am a believer that it is possible to time the market to enhance returns, and have a watch-list of stocks that I'm hoping 
will fall into my buy zone.  


### Consumer Staples

My largest position remains **BATS**, which provides good income and is an asset light, non cyclical.  I've noted that at times, 
it does appear to be [uncorrelated to the market]({% post_url 2018-02-08-Asset-Alloc-Correlation %}), which I like from a portfolio 
perspective (bond substitute).  The price fell significantly during the year but I averaged down in the 22-23 area, creating a very 
unbalanced portfolio.  I sold about a third in the 28-29 area, and have the significant dividends on top.  I may trim this further 
but will keep a high overweight as I think it provides me with a safe income stream with unrecognised growth catalysts (Vapes+oral, 
EM exposure, call option on weed).  BATS are managing their debt "maturity wall" well, once it becomes apparent it's a non-issue 
I'd expect a re-rate (catalyst could be increased buybacks).

Following Nick Train, I initiated a **Diageo** position - which kept falling.  This gave some premium Brands exposure, choosing this as 
less keen on other options such as Unilever.  However, I subsequently sold the position to crystallise a loss, I was unconvinced 
on the inflation protection of DGE's premium brands and the market gave better opportunities elsewhere.


### Oil and Gas

Oil and Gas exposure is via **offshore drillers** ("Steel on water") which should be long term beneficiaries of structural inflation 
and my [energy theme]({% post_url 2020-07-12-Secular-Trend-Energy-Inflation %}).  These shares trade at 2022 levels, at a fraction of 
book value.   I think they give better inflation protection than regular oil and gas companies and with significantly less political 
risk.  The industry is **consolidating**, which should lead to **pricing power** for the **scarce assets with high barriers to entry**. 

They have fallen significantly and I've averaged down making them large holdings.  These are highly cyclical, with the ability 
to multibag, then probably lose it again quickly.  I expect this cycle's performance may exceed that of the last: offshore is 
one of the cheapest options for oil companies, the theory is that there will be a shortage of rigs.  It takes years to build a new 
rig/drillship,  less credit may be available this time around (burned last cycle) and so day rates should move up.

**Borr Drilling** gives exposure to Jackups.  Some of the recent negative price action may be explained from them de-listing in Oslo, with 
Norwegian pensions / sovereign wealth unable to hold.  **Transocean** is a high debt company focused on semi-subs/drillships, this could 
give the best return but at a high risk (in an inflationary environment the debt becomes an asset).  **Valaris** is in the same segment 
as Transocean, but with little debt after coming out of bankruptcy. 


### Coal

The narrative on coal is that it is being phased out and replaced with green alternatives.  However, a recent IEA report paints a 
different picture, noting that **2024 coal demand was at a record high** and now sees higher demand in 25, 26, 27.  Never mind peak oil, 
we haven't even hit peak coal!

My coal exposure is via Whitehaven, Warrior and Glencore, which includes both Thermal and Coking coal.  Both **Whitehaven** and **Glencore** 
have completed significant coal transactions, and I think that as these are digested and the cashflow appears, we could see a re-rate 
of the shares.  The catalyst for **Warrior Met Coal** is that it's building a new mine which should come online shortly.

I've also been looking at Alpha Metallurgical Resources, and may switch some offshore money into that to reduce overweight offshore risk.



### Commodities
My commodity exposure is through Vale and Glencore.  I split the (~40%) coal out of the Glencore holding and count it under the coal 
weighting for better visibility.  

My emphasis is on the bulks which, although isn't sexy, is apparently where the money is made.  Near term Iron Ore demand looks suspect, 
but I'm hoping this is priced in.  Iron ore is a proxy for world growth (infrastructure, buildings, etc) and I think it should be OK, 
especially if there is any stimulus. 

My **Vale** holding grew too large as I averaged down, I've since crystallised losses and moved into offshore to diversify.  It's very cheap, 
and I was expecting a bounce now the new CEO has been appointed and that the damages for the dam collapse decided.  As a huge % constituent 
in the Brazil market, I believe it has been driven down further due to the sell off there.  I'm stopped out of buying more due to 30 day rule, 
probably a good thing.

**Glencore** gives me exposure to Coal and Copper.   They also get a significant amount of revenue from a trading business, which will act as an 
internal hedge as it should make money in both raising and falling markets.  They recently bought Teck's coal business, and I'm expecting a 
significant increase in profits from them.  I like Glencore's approach - unlike their peers, they are happy to invest in coal rather than 
pander to the ESG movement.

A purchase of **Trident Royalties** resulted in a 20% gain, following their takeover by an Australian royalty company.

I sold my investment in **Ecora Resources** for a large loss. It was a bad investment, the most ESG of my holdings (battery metals) didn't fit 
with my theme.  The share price performance reflected the 2024 acquisitions of battery metal royalties on mines which now look like they 
may not get built following the crash in the Nickel price. Ecora may suffer from EV take-up slowdown and may be have issues once their coal 
royalty comes to an end (Ironic that the 'woke' company is relying on coal).  I moved the sale proceeds into Glencore as I prefer their 
coal/copper mix, more of a sure thing (not betting on battery Chemistries).


### Precious Metals
A huge position in **Adriatic Metals** was sold prior to the expected re-rate, for a 30%-ish gain.   The share often moved before official 
announcements, the CFO resigned and so I decided to cut my gains.  Subsequently the CEO resigned and the price crashed, but since 
recovered.  Going forward, I am going to avoid smaller miners as think larger companies offer better risk reward.

There were also successful trades in the PGM miner, **Sibanye Stillwater**.  I decided that I didn't have to make my ECOR losses back the same way 
I lost them, so bought SBSW in low/mid 4's and sold at high 5's.  However, I was uncomfortable with the holding (debt) and sold to buy PGMs directly.

I initiated a significant position in **Platinum**.  The metal has traded above gold in the past but now is substantially cheaper, it would have to 
2.5x to get back to that level.  The asymmetric risk reward looks good, with maybe 20% downside or so.  It has suffered from 
expected lack of demand due to EVs, but this now appears to be in doubt as many manufacturers pulling back from EVs and instead looking at 
hybrids.  Platinum also has other 'green' growth uses such as hydrogen fuel cells.  I've read that many jewellers are stocking more platinum 
as the working capital required is much less than holding a large stock of gold jewellery.  Platinum is a veblen good, a higher price makes 
it more sought after, increasing demand (like luxury handbags).

Taking the advice "You rarely get an opportunity to buy a quality company at a discounted price", I initiated a small position in **Franco 
Nevada**.  A levered play on gold with better inflation protection than the miners.  It has fallen a lot due to the closure of one of its 
main mines in Panama, but there is speculation it could re-open.    Either way, with central banks buying gold (following Russian reserve 
confiscation), I think the share has good prospects.


### Japan
Japan is one of the worlds cheapest markets, and I was keen to get exposure to the small cap, deep value theme using AJOT.  But that raced away 
from me and so I decided that **BG Shin Nippon** at a 16% discount and near multi year lows was a good alternative.  Japan Small Cap deep value has had 
good performance and I think some of this has been at the expense of small cap growth, which I hope will mean revert.  Long term, I still prefer the 
value theme and so may switch should the opportunity arise.


### Comment

Performance up until November was good, well ahead of benchmarks, but then experienced a rapid drop off in December.  I think it's has likely suffered due 
to end of year tax loss selling.

Full year performance has been saved by my overweight BATS position, which has cushioned the losses elsewhere.  I have used this as a funding 
source to top up elsewhere.

My intention is not to follow the crowd, and avoid overvalued areas of the market - specifically tech dominated US markets.  It is psychologically 
uncomfortable to go against the crowd and buy unloved sectors that keep falling.  My position sizes are too large, yet I find it difficult to diversify 
into other areas where I'm less keen on the outlook.  I think Buffett(?) talked about 50% of portfolio in your best idea, 10th idea not as good as 1st, etc.

No real insight into what 2025 has in store, only that my investment ideas have some rationale to suggest growth in the medium term.  I had hundreds 
of trades this year, which I think did add value - I plan to trade less going forward as I am keen to minimise tax the consequences.
