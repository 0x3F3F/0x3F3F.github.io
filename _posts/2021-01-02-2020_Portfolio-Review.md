## Commentary

Performance this year was good, better than [last year]({% post_url 2020-01-02-2019_Portfolio-Review %}).  I 
achieved an overall return of  **+40%**, ahead of both the `RPI+3%` (+4%), and the `FTSEAS-TR` (-9%) benchmarks.  

I managed to avoid losing money in the February dip, selling holdings before it.  It was apparent there was trouble 
ahead in January when twitter was full of China lockdown talk, the slow market reaction was hard to explain.  Having 
nailed the dip, I then completely missed the bounce, Doh!



## Multi Asset Portfolio

<img style="border: 0;" src="/img/2021/20210102_MA2.png" />

The `Multi Asset portfolio` returned **+8%**, avoiding the bulk of the Mar/Feb sell-off and finishing ahead of both `FTSEAS-TR` 
(with less volatility) and `RPI+3%`.  I intend to continue adding to this portfolio.  

I have been trying to time my entry here, but now questioning my rationale given that the funds are ~60% bonds/cash.  I 
have deffo lost money by not just investing and forgetting about it.


## Growth Portfolio

<img style="border: 0;" src="/img/2021/20210102_G2.png" />

The `Growth portfolio` returned **+55%** which was well ahead of both it's benchmarks, though more volatile than I'd 
like.  This return was largely due to my market timing of the entry point (after years waiting!), I never 
really believed in the can't time the market mantra - except now for multi asset funds.  

Holdings in the Growth Portfolio were increased significantly during the year, influenced by the increase 
in government money printing and my uneasiness in holding a high cash weighting.  Most purchases were 
commodity related, which presented the best risk-reward following the March sell-off.  In truth, I 
missed the equities bounce, but was nimble enough to position in commodities, which are 
<a href="https://www.iainbenson.com/investment/2019/11/28/Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle.html#investment-thesis">historically cheap</a>. 


#### Precious Metals
The [Currency Debasement]({% post_url 2019-11-08-Secular-Trend-Currency-Debasement %}) theme performed well this 
year.  Following the collapse in markets around Feb/Mar time, I added to my holdings when silver was around 
$14/15-ish.  The price then doubled and I thought it prudent to take some profit after such a quick gain - but like a 
**good pirate**, I still retain a large weighting.  I've also purchased a mid sized gold 
<a href="https://www.iainbenson.com/investment/2019/11/28/Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle.html#royalty-companies">royalty company</a> 
which should do well in a precious metals bull market.  I plan to keep an overall weighting below that of energy as 
the oil:gold ratio is in oil's favour.


#### Oil & Gas
With the economy shutting down, many oil companies prices fell significantly to multi decade lows.  In my 
view, this has presented one of the (apparently many) opportunities of a lifetime as I'm expecting 
[Energy Inflation]({% post_url 2020-07-12-Secular-Trend-Energy-Inflation %}).  I invested in a
Canadian royalty and a large cap integrated oil company.  In an inflationary environment, royalty 
companies will continue to receive their 'rent' without having to drill expensive holes.  The other 
investment was in `Suncor`; the main attraction being that it is low cost producer with ~30year 
reserve life (Compared to Shell ~9yrs).  In an inflationary environment, Suncor won't be forced to 
pay ever increasing costs to expand their reserves, they'll just continue to dig it out the ground 
and shove it on the back of a truck, or something like that.  They should benefit fully from price 
increases.  That's the theory.


#### Uranium Supply / Demand
As part of the [Electricity Demand]({% post_url 2019-11-15-Secular-Trend-Electricity-Demand %}) theme, my basket was 
reduced to only 2 companies.  `Energy Fuels` was sold as it diluted ~30% despite previously stating it had sufficient 
cash.  Investigation showed significant dilution in previous years, so I took the opportunity to sell on a  
bounce and rebalanced into general commodities for a more balanced portfolio.  It since doubled, though I still believe 
my decision was correct.  In truth, I was beginning to view the uranium sector as pretty un-investable, with most companies 
likely to dilute significantly but the recovery looks like it may be under way with my largest holding `Nexgen Energy` up by 80%.

 
#### Base Metal Royalties
I started adding holdings to the [Commodity Cycle]({% post_url 2019-11-28-Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle %}) 
theme, buying into 2 base metal Royalty companies (and selling CNY prior to Covid dip).  One of the companies 
provides exposure to [copper](https://www.bhp.com/media-and-insights/prospects/2017/11/ten-reasons-why-we-like-copper/), 
potash and Iron ore and the other coal, copper, and potentially battery metals. Royalty companies should offer a 
low risk way to gain exposure to the secular commodity theme.  


#### Other Stuff
An investment was made into a Global Macro / Relative Value hedge feeder fund.  ETF people should look away now, 
as the fees are eye-watering.  The rationale here is it is one of the few sources of non correlated returns 
available to non institutional investors (remember the 
[importance of non correlating assets]({% post_url 2018-02-08-Asset-Alloc-Correlation %})?).  I'm using it 
as a sort of bond substitute, bond holdings were decreased as they offer little upside and potentially a lot of 
downside.  Even after the fees, the performance of the fund is good - At least that's what I'm telling myself 
as I'm helping to make someone else rich.


I bought shares in a `BATS` trading around 9 year lows due to ESG concerns.  These should be defensive and provide 
a good dividend.  It is in the best performing sector of the last 100 years -  I don't see that changing as they 
are an asset light, high return business selling an addictive product.  Additionally, they have high barriers to 
entry as the advertising ban means no new competitors or need to spend on advertising.  Their interests are highly 
aligned with governments (tax generator).

Reviewing the above - I appear to be investing in a general **anti-ESG theme**, which has left some companies seriously 
undervalued as investors are herded into ESG friendly funds.  I don't think this is an accident, a sort of bait and 
switch thingy awaits.  Another possibility is that cash could continue flowing out and I keep collecting large 
sustainable dividends, either is fine by me.


## The Great Crypto Experiment of 2020

Alternatively, the Mediocre-at-Best Crypto Experiment.  Anyway, long storey short: I got bored and wrote 
some scripts to generate crypto addresses, bought ~800 quids worth of i`XRP`, transferred it to my address, it worked!, 
it trebled, SEC launched legal case against Ripple, it halved and I sold.  I should have invested in bitcoin instead:

<img style="border: 0;" src="/img/2021/20210102_Kuppy.png" />

The SEC consider `XRP` as a security and there is the real possibility the exchanges will de-list it.  I do wonder 
about the viability of other cryptos, if the government can crash them overnight. I know about defi, this ones different, 
etc, but the government could make things really tough if they wanted to (see 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyQsWfsTenw) on that topic).  Think that's probably
the end of my crypto adventures.


## Conclusion 

Although the returns this year have been very good, I'm annoyed at myself for not investing more in the 
Feb/Mar drawdown. Being too conservative meant that only a small portion of overall worth befitted 
form the large gains.  I was expecting further significant falls and didn't foresee the large government 
stimulus, though don't think the magnitude was predictable :

> Took unprecedented Fed BS ($4Trillion or 2x 2008) + buying corp debt + repo in response
> to a -30% drawdown to prevent financial system meltdown.
 
And now, an important public service announcement:

> To everyone who got into trading stocks this year, I have a little hard truth for you:
> You're not actually that god at it.  You just got caught a wild bull market.  Take some money off the table.

Think I agree with that, though not enough to take any money off the table.  End of year
was a bit melt up-ey, do expect decent pullback.

In the `Growth Portfolio`, I'm still looking to deploy money into an Emerging Market Consumer theme and 
also a value orientated special situations fund, as you do.  I know, it's a growth portfolio.  They don't 
look like they're going to get any cheaper, so I may average into these over the coming year - possibly 
only at a half weighting.

With the governments need for money, it's likely CGT will increase and so tax risk needs to be considered 
when constructing the portfolio.  The only way I see of mitigating against this risk is to divert investments 
into broad based funds where there won't ever be a need to sell and incur CGT.  I'll need to take the 
hit on some of the asymmetric themes in the Growth portfolio, though even there I've a 5/10year horizon 
and might even lose money.

In terms of 2021 predictions, I don't have any insight.  People are questioning whether (following the 
stimulus) the business cycle still exists? Stocks could easily up 40% or down 40%, failure to 
predict market moves this year has re-enforced the fact that I've short term no edge, hopefully my longer 
term investment theses hold up.  I'm thinking it may be risky holding cash going into 2022,
possibly get another chance to position in 2021.  On that topic, this guy "knows his shit" &trade; :

My plan is to try and focus on not doing anything too stupid: 
- don't pay too much
- don't concentrate holdings
- don't feel forced to quickly invest as markets shoot higher.  

I'm already failing on at least one of those.  Most investments will likely now be in the Multi Asset 
category as I've less chance of screwing that up.
