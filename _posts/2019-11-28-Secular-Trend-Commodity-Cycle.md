## Investment Thesis

Since the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting QE, financial assets have significantly 
outperformed real assets.  The following chart shows just how extreme this outperformance is:

Interest rates now around their limits at the zero bound, new policies are being considered 
(MMT) which are said to be much more inflationary.  

The last time we were in an inflationary environment was 1970s, equities were shunned
and commodities performed very well.  My thesis is that in the near future, the bear
market  in real assets will end and they will once again outperform.

Considering the ~10 year underperformance of commodities in the above chart, revision
to the mean suggests that they could be a good place to be.

In the event of a recession, my expectation is for the value of real assets to drop as well as
equities.  If they were to fall, then they're falling from a low base and I'd expect a quick 
recovery.


## Method

Strictly speaking, my large allocation to uranium as part of my [Electricity Demand]({% post_url 2019-11-15-Secular-Trend-Electricity-Demand %}) 
theme should be considered a commodity allocation - but I'm choosing to put that in a different 
silo as has it's own driving factors.

This theme is more general and I intend to play it by investing in **royalty companies** focused on 
base metals, rather than commodity funds.  As [Horizon Kinetics](https://horizonkinetics.com/app/uploads/Q4-2020-Review_Final_Approved.pdf) explain:

>While mining companies have appreciated during brief bouts of inflation, they have done poorly during extended 
>periods of inflation. This is because they are asset intensive businesses, both as to physical capital and human 
>capital. Over time, inflation acts upon the cost of replacing equipment, of purchasing and developing new 
>reserves, and of retaining and compensating employees.  This erodes both profit margins and the stock valuations.  

Russel Clark gave an example of this when he who noted that  BHP lost 90% of its value in the 1970s during an inflation 
boom.  Horizon Kinetics go on to explain that there is a limited universe of business models that are **asset-light**, 
rather than asset intensive, and which derive their revenues from assets that tend to be inflation vectors.  One example 
is a royalty company.


## Royalty Companies

>"The best business is a royalty on the growth of others  - requiring little capital itself" Warren Buffett

Royalty companies can be considered as a finance business rather than a mining business, providing 
capital in exchange for revenues.  Royalty companies donâ€™t require capital equipment or property; neither do 
they have any operations per se, just administrative staff. Therefore, they benefit fully from any increase 
in the price and volume of the underlying commodity in which they have a royalty interest. 

Advantages include: 

- Very high profit margins (profitable even if commodity price declines)
- Low Risk(I): Mining companies must pay royalties prior to all other deductions.
- Low Risk(II): Falling commodity prices squeeze miners costs.  Royalties unaffected.
- Low Risk(III): Unaffected by unexpected costs (cost overruns etc).
- Better Inflation Hedge: Mining cost increases => Less profits for Miners.  Royalties unaffected. 
- Upside not priced in (Mine life extensions, Commodity price increases, New discoveries)
- Trading at low multiples to NAV when compared with precious metal peers.

One obvious question: if royalties are so profitable, why do mining companies sell them?
The reason is that after selling a royalty, the mining companies don't start to pay back until the mine is
producing, which can be several years.  If they instead chose debt, they would have years of interest payments 
to make prior to production


As well as capturing the commodity upside, it is anticipated that the discounts to NAV should narrow as 
the companies increase in size as borrowing becomes cheaper.
