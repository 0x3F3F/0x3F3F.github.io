## Investment Thesis

Since the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting QE, financial assets have significantly 
outperformed real assets.  The following chart shows just how extreme this outperformance is:

Interest rates now around their limits at the zero bound, new policies are being considered 
(MMT) which are said to be much more inflationary.  

The last time we were in an inflationary environment was 1970s, equities were shunned
and commodities performed very well.  My thesis is that in the near future, the bear
market  in real assets will end and they will once again outperform.

Considering the ~10 year underperformance of commodities in the above chart, revision
to the mean suggests that they could be a good place to be.

In the event of a recession, my expectation is for the value of real assets to drop as well as
equities.  If they were to fall, then they're falling from a low base and I'd expect a quick 
recovery.


## Method

Strictly speaking, my large allocation to uranium as part of my [Electricity Demand]({% post_url 2019-11-15-Secular-Trend-Electricity-Demand %}) 
theme should be considered a commodity allocation - but I'm choosing to put that in a different 
silo as has it's own unique driving factors.

I intend to play this theme my investing in Royalty / Streaming companies, rather than miners 
or commodity funds.  Royalty companies can be considered as a finance business rather than
a mining business, providing capital in exchange for revenues.  Advantages include: 

- Get royalty before deductions.  Low risk way to gain exposure.
- When commodity prices fall and squeeze miners costs, there is no effect on royalty company.
- Better Inflation Hedge: Mining cost increases => Less profits for Miners.  Royalties unaffected. 
- Not affected by mining issues (cost overruns etc)
- Upside not priced in (Mine life extensions, Commmdty price increases, New discoveries)
- Trading at low values to NAV when compared with precious metal peers.

As well as capturing the commodity upside, it is anticipated that the discounts to NAV
should narrow as the companies increase in size as borrowing becomes cheaper.
