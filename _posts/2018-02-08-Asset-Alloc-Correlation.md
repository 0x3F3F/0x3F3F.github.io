title: Importance of Non-Correlation In Asset Allocation

I recently came across the chart below and thought I'd save it for future reference, along with some brief notes.

I intend to operate my investments based on a rough asset allocation model, I'll post more on this at a later date.  I had been 
aware that asset allocations such as the Harry Brown portfolio can give results similar to 100% equity, but with 
significantly less volatility ie with max draw downs in teens instead of 50%+

Here's the chart:

Between 1916-2016, the return on S&P was 18.4 times, compared to 37.9 times for the S&P/BGMI rebalanced portfolio.

It may seem quite unintuitive, but the chart is showing that **adding a vastly underperforming asset can significantly 
increase the total return** of a re-balanced portfolio compared to 100% equity.  The **key is that the assets are uncorrelated**, 
that one is zigging while the other zagging - this is more important than the return of the asset. 


Mark Spiz-nagel explains this as follows:

*"As long as the underperforming component adds value during market weakness, the rebalanced portfolio experiences 
reduced drawdowns and, therefore, compounds at a higher rate over time. Most sensible investors look only for
opportunities with the highest returns, but long term returns greatly depend on having uncorrelated components,
even if some of those components have a low return or even no overall return"*

Another point worth bearing in mind is how correlations may change over time.  Currently many 60:40 equity/bond portfolios are 
popular. In the past bonds/equities have been uncorrelated and so provided a good hedge, the worry is that in the recent past 
they have both been increasing (so more correlated) and so may not provide the protection their owners expect.

## Correlation Analysis

The following table, taken from a PWC report on sovereign wealth funds, shows the result of their analysis on correlations between 
various asset classes:

I've included the 10 year and 20 year tables, to roughly cover a market cycle and longer term.  

To recap, the correlation figures range between 1 and -1, where +1 is a perfect correlation (when one item goes up, so does the other) and 
0 represents no correlation (no relationship betwen the items).  Negative values signify negative correlations, that is when one goes up 
the other goes down.

W.r.t. equities, the table indicates that gold is a useful diversifier, with no correlation.  It also shows that bonds have been an excellent diversifier, 
being strongly negatively correlated.  Commodities too look like they could be useful, though they appear to be more correlated in the recent 
past. The other item missing from the table is cash.

The Bond/equity correlations go from -0.39 (20y), -0.29(10y), -0.13(5y) which shows that they are clearly becoming more correlated.  So maybe not as essential as 
the table suggests?

This information should provide a helpful starting point when thinking about an initial portfolio asset allocation.
