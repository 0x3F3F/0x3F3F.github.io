title: Importance of Non-Correlation In Asset Allocation

I intend to operate my investments based on a rough asset allocation model, aware of asset 
allocations such as the Harry Brown portfolio can give results similar to 100% equity, but 
with significantly less volatility.  

Interesting chart time:

Between 1916-2016, the return on S&P was 18.4 times, compared to 37.9 times for the S&P/BGMI rebalanced portfolio.

It may seem quite unintuitive, but the chart is showing that **adding a vastly underperforming asset can significantly 
increase the total return** of a re-balanced portfolio compared to 100% equity.  The **key is that the assets are uncorrelated**, 
that one is zigging while the other zagging - this is more important than the return of the asset. 


Mark Spiz-nagel explains this as follows:

> As long as the underperforming component adds value during market weakness, the rebalanced portfolio experiences 
> reduced drawdowns and, therefore, compounds at a higher rate over time. Most sensible investors look only for
> opportunities with the highest returns, but long term **returns greatly depend on** having **uncorrelated** components,
> even if some of those components have a low return or **even no overall return**

In their ["The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent"](https://www.artemiscm.com/research) report, Artemis Capital detail 
how to invest for 100 years.  To summarise: 

> "Anti-correlation is worth more than excess return"

Liked that. The secret of investment in less than 8 words.  It's worth reading that note in it's entirety.

## The Classic 60/40 Portfolio

I have always questioned the validity of this popular asset allocation, as bonds and stocks are not always negatively 
correlated.

The above Artemis Capital note confirms my suspicions, stating that 90% of the price appreciation of such a portfolio 
came between 1984-2007.   They show that the **returns** for bonds and equities over this time period **were an outlier** 
and the 60/40 portfolio is highly reliant on **"assumptions derived from a once in a century bull market in Stocks and 
Bonds"**.  As they shrewdly observe: 

> "Recency Bias in now a Systematic Risk"

The note states that while these portfolios perform well in secular booms, they struggle when interest rates 
are at the zero bound (US 1930, Japan 90's) or during periods of rapidly rising inflation (US 1970s).  Like now.

In short, 60/40 portfolios may not provide the protection or return that their owners expect.  Not that I'd expect 
them to pay any attention to these warnings, given their recent performance.  Killer quote time:

> "Most investors would rather fail conventionally than succeed unconventionally"


## Correlation Analysis

The following table, taken from a PWC report on sovereign wealth funds, shows the result of their analysis on correlations between 
various asset classes:

![Asset Allocation Correlation](/img/2018/20180208_CorrelationAnalysis.jpg)

I've included the 10 year and 20 year tables, to roughly cover a market cycle and longer term.  

To recap, the correlation figures range between 1 and -1, where +1 is a perfect correlation (when one item goes 
up, so does the other) and 0 represents no correlation (no relationship between the items).  Negative values 
signify negative correlations, that is when one goes up the other goes down.

W.r.t. equities, the table indicates that gold is a useful diversifier, with no correlation.  It also shows that 
bonds have been an excellent diversifier, being strongly negatively correlated.  Commodities too look like they 
could be useful, though they appear to be more correlated in the recent past. The other item missing from the 
table is cash.  

The Bond/equity correlations go from -0.39 (20y), -0.29(10y), -0.13(5y) which shows that they are clearly becoming 
more correlated.  Note the Artemis capital comments above regarding bonds performance when interest rates are near 
the zero bound.
