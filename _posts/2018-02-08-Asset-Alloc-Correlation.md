title: Importance of Correlation In Asset Allocation

I recently came across the chart below and thought I'd save it for future reference, along with some brief notes.

I operate my investments based on a rough asset allocation model, I'll probably post more on this later.  I had been 
aware that asset allocations such as the Harry Brown portfolio can give results similar to 100% equity, but with 
significantly less volatility ie with max draw downs in teens instead of 50%+.

Here's the chart:

![Asset Allocation Correlation](/img/2018/20180208_AACorrelation.jpg)

Between 1916-2016, the return on S&P was 18.4 times, compared to 37.9 times for the rebalanced portfolio.

It may seem quite unintuitive, but the chart is showing that __adding a vastly underperforming asset can significantly 
increase the total return__ of a re-balanced portfolio compared to 100% equity.  The key is that the __assets are uncorrelated__, 
that one is zigging while the other zagging - this is more important than the return of the asset (which is aweful).  


Mark Spiz nagel explains this as follows:

*As long as the underperforming component adds value during market weakness, the rebalanced portfolio experiences 
reduced drawdowns and, therefore, compounds at a higher rate over time. Most sensible investors look only for
opportunities with the highest returns, but __long term returns greatly depend on having uncorrelated components__,
even if some of those components have a low return or even no overall return*

Another point worth bearing in mind is how correlations may change over time.  Currently many 60:40 equity/bond portfolios are 
popular. In the past bonds/equities have been uncorrelated and so provided a good hedge, my worry is that in the recent past 
they have both been increasing (and correlated) and so may not provide the protection their owners expect.
