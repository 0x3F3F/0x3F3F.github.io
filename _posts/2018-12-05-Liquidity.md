## Liquidity

As I have a large percentage of my Portfolio in Cash, I've been watching the Brexit
situation with interest.  The direction of GBP appears to be a binary bet on the outcome
of the next weeks vote.

Given this, I started moving cash out of pounds sterling and into USD, which many feel
could outperform due to a dollar shortage.  I has hoped for a dip, to move more across,
though have managed to re-allocate a large percentage my cash holdings.

In the unlikely event of a successful leave vote, I can see sterling increasing v's
USD/EUR.  I think more likely there'll be indecision and it will drop further.  Some
talking of parity to USD.

As of today, here's how things stand in the cash part of my portfolio:

**Short Term Treasuries (IBTM)** - These have short duration and so are a proxy for USD.  Not
sensitive to interest rates, so a good safe store of value.

**Medium / Long Term Tersuries (IBTM / IBTL)** - There introduce interest rate volatility,
with the latter being particularly sensitive.  However, should there be a market downturn,
they should benifit.  Many people think this will be the trade for 2019.

**Short Duration TIPS (TP05)** - Infation protexted bonds with short duration.  I've added these as
many of my multi asset fulds hold similar. Seem a safe place to hide.

**Gold** - It's shiney.

So.  A bit of everything, which should allow me to live to fight another day.  I'm retaining a sterling 
chunk which will allow me to take advantage of any downturn, though may decrease further.  

Things are made more difficult in that my accounting is in Euros, so may have to pay gains, but there's no way round this.

I managed to circumvent the earlier devaluation, so hoping for similar.  We'll see.
