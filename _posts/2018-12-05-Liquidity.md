A rather dull topic, though worth a note so as I can document my thoughts for future
reference w.r.t. currency holdings over the Brexit transition.

As I have a large percentage of my Portfolio in Cash, I've been watching the Brexit
situation with reluctant interest.  The near term direction of `GBP` appears to be a **binary 
bet** on the outcome of the next weeks vote.

Given this, I started moving cash out of pounds sterling and into `USD`, which many feel
could outperform due to a dollar shortage.  I had hoped for more of a dip to move more across,
but have managed to re-allocate a large percentage my cash holdings.

In the unlikely event of a successful leave vote, I can see sterling increasing against
other currencies.  I think more likely there'll be indecision and it will drop further.  Regardless,
I'm expecting the long term down trend in Sterling and so the trade represents good risk/reward. 

As of today, here's how things stand in the cash part of my portfolio:

**Short Term US Treasuries** (`IBTM`) - These have short duration and so are a **proxy for USD**.  Not
sensitive to interest rates, so a good safe store of value.

**Medium / Long Term US Treasuries** (`IBTM` / `IBTL`) - `USD` exposure but introduce interest rate risk,
with the latter being particularly sensitive.  However, on a market downturn (which I'm
expecting) they should benefit.  Many people think this will be **the** trade for 2019.

**Short Duration TIPS** (`TP05`) - Inflation protected US bonds with short duration.  I've added these as
many of my multi asset funds hold similar and they seem a safe place to hide.

**Gold** - It's shiny. I wasn't sure to include this, hence one cart with/without above.

So, a bit of everything - choosing not to be exactly right or exactly wrong, but somewhere in between, 
allowing me to live to fight another day.  I'm retaining a sterling chunk which will allow me to take 
advantage of any downturn in the market.  

Things are made more difficult in that my accounting is in Euros, so may have to pay gains that otherwise wouldn't.  There's no way round this.  

**Summary:** It's a difficult environment to choose where to hold liquidity and I'm hedging
my bets.  I managed to largely circumvent the earlier devaluation, so hoping for similar this time round.
