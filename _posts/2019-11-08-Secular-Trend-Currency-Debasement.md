> "Paper money will always return to its intrinsic value. Zero."

In a fiat based monetary system, the value of money is slowly eroded over time which amounts 
to a significant **hidden tax on savings**.  Governments can borrow money via the bond market and 
pay back with devalued money in the future.  A gold sovereign (the original pound coin) had a value 
that remained static for 100s of years, until the advent of fiat money - it's now worth ~275x 
what it originally was.

In contrast, gold is an extremely **stable store of value**.  They say that in Roman times, an
ounce of gold would buy a toga and a fine meal and that today that same ounce would buy a
suit and a similar meal.

Many governments like to describe gold as merely a pet rock, even though their central
banks are rushing repatriate their holdings and increase them as they likely know what is 
in store.  It's in their interests to talk it down, yet occasionally the truth 
slips out.  Here's a recent quote from the Dutch central bank :

> Gold is the perfect piggy bank, it's the anchor of trust for the financial system.  
> If the system collapses, the gold stock can serve as a basis to build it up again.

Gold can't be printed, it's growth closely matches that of worldwide population growth.  Gold 
is universally recognised as having great value (game theory ['Schelling
point'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) ). 
It has all the properties of money as described by Aristotle.

With the dramatic **escalation of money printing** in recent years and **bonds no longer giving
any return**, it makes sense to hold a sizeable percentage of a portfolio in precious metals.

Given golds few other uses, when the time comes it can be instantly revalued to any dollar value
without knock-on effects, then used to back currencies and wipe out sovereign debt.


## Silver
	
> Gold is the money of kings, silver is the money of gentlemen, barter is the money of peasants &  debt is the money of slaves

Silver is significantly more volatile than gold, but the **potential returns are far greater**. 
This is the reason that I have opted to hold it in my growth portfolio - as a levered
play on currency debasement.

Compared to gold, silver is a tiny market.  The same amount of money entering the silver
market would drive it far higher.  Alternatively, the market could be contained (manipulated) with 
a far smaller amount of money. 

Silver is both a precious and an industrial metal.  It is a by-product of other industrial
metal mining and so in a crisis I'd expect its supply to decrease and support the price.

## Gold / Silver Ratio

One key aspect of silver investment is the ratio of gold to silver, currently around 85.  In 
times of crisis this could decrease to around 20 or so, which gives the leverage to supercharge 
the returns.

The natural ratio of gold to silver is said to be 17.5:1 which is close to the monetary
ratio used in the 19th century of 16:1.  In the 1970's the Hunt brothers expected the
ratio to go to 5 - so 85 seems a good entry point.

Also consider that, as an industrial metal, Silver is consumed (65%) whereas all the gold that
has ever been mined still sits in Vault.  This should put a steady downward pressure on
the ratio.


## Miners

Precious metal mining stocks are another alternative 'levered' play on currency
debasement, with explosive returns.

I had intended to invest in 'Jr' miners, though the following charts have
caused me to reconsider this as **long term returns are very poor**, as can be seen in the 
chart below.  Investment in silver looks to be as good during bull phases and much better 
over longer time frames, with no company risk.

In the charts below the black line is the Barrons Gold Mining Index and the blue the
Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index:
