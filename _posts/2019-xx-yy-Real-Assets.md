Since the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting QE, financial assets have significantly 
outperformed real assets.  The following chart shows just how extreme this outperformance is:

With interest rates now around their limits, new policies are being considered (MMT) which
are said to be much more inflationary.  

The last time we were in an inflationary environment was 70s when equities were shunned
and commodities performed very well.  My thesis is that in the near future, real assets
will once again outperform.

Even considering the 10 year underperformance of commodities in the above chart, revision
to the mean suggests that they could be a good place to be.

In the event of a recession, I'd expect the value of real assets to drop ans well as
equities and so am not piling in at the moment.  If they do fall, then they're falling
from a low base and I'm expect a quick recovery, whereas equities could take a decade to
recover.

I plan to expand on this theme in the future
