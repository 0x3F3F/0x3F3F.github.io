title: RSS Feed Readers Part I - FreshRSS
category: linux
tags: [ 'RSS' ]
---

I've recently been playing around with feedreaders, and how I get my data from the web.  I was previously using Feedly, but then decided I didn't want to share my data with them (linked to Facebook account).  I then signed up for [thefeedreader.com](www.thefeedreader.com) which is decent, but not exactly what I was after. So I thought I'd try out a couple of alternatives.

The first one I tried was [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) which is a web based reader, though a self hosted solution.  It was between this and TinyTinyRSS, but I decided to go with this one as it could be setup using a SQLIte Db rather than MySQL - I thought it would be easier for my Raspbery Pi to handle.

## Setup

I previously had [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net) installed on the Pi but after reading about it being buggy, I decided to remove and install [nginx](https://nginx.org/) instead.  I more or less followed [this guide](http://www.pihomeserver.fr/en/2013/05/08/raspberry-pi-home-server-installer-un-agregateur-de-flux-rss-pour-remplacer-google-reader/) to install, though did hit upon an issue in that the PHP components were version 7.0 instead of 5 (just replaced 5 with 7.0 in the commands).

After setting up, the FreshRSS install didn't go as planned as it stated I was missing libraries to process XML and DOM.  This was especially annoying as it didn't tell me what was missing.  I was trying to instal libxml2 but that didn't work and the PHP website wasn't much use either.  I randomly stumbled across a site that mentioned installing php7.0-xml and so I tried that - it worked!

I added some feeds and it looked like this:

## Hacking About

Everything was grand, almost.  I didn't like the way it was handelling my twitter feeds.  They were truncated and I decided I wanted to click on a link and get taken to that users page - so I could read all the new tweets at once.  I played around with writing a plug-in, though later found out it didn't work as the links in the feed were potentially another users (if it was a Re-Tweet).  In case it's of any use, this is sort of what I had:


	class TwitterLinksExtension extends Minz_Extension {
	    public function init() {
	        //$this->registerHook('entry_before_insert', array($this, 'transformLink'));

	        // Use this one for debug.  Doesn't store in Db
	        $this->registerHook('entry_before_display', array($this, 'transformLink'));
	    }

	    public function transformLink($entry) {
	        // $entry is FreshRSS_Entry objecy
	        // Accessible fields:
	        // title, author, content, link, date, is_read, is_favourite, feed

	        $link = $entry->link();

	        // Only apply this stuff two twitter feed items
	         if (false === strpos($link, 'twitter.com')) {
	            return $entry;
	        }

	        // Store the content
	        $content = $entry->content();

	        // Get the link the the users page
	        // Note author contains re-tweeters name, not the user I'm following
	        // Don't work for retweets as has retweeter.
	        $pos = strpos($link,'/', 20);
	        $timelineLink = substr($link, 0, $pos);
	        $entry->_content(sprintf('%s <p>Link %s</p>', $content, $entry->feed()));
	        return $entry;
	    }
	}

Plan B involved hacking around the helper files (`app/views/helpers/index/normal/entry_header.phtml`) to change the links with a bit of php.  Not very nice really, but got the job done -  I'm sure there's an alternative that's better, but difficult with to lack of documentation etc.

Overall, the program seemed good and I liked the clean look.  There were a few negatives though, so I'll be back with a part II.  To summarise my thoughts on this feed reader:

### Pros

- Nice clean interface
- Not depending on 3rd parties.  
- Can modify it, but not super easy (See code above)

### Cons

- Not much documentation.  Code is well commented but IN FRENCH. Harder for me to hack about with.
- I'm not familiar with MVC / PHP anymore.  Mixture of html/PHP looks like a dogs dinner.
- Do I want to keep my Raspberry Pi turned on all the time?? Thought about Rsyncing the Db with my linux machine as could then hand off Db.
- Not all links work well with vimprenator (or Tridactyl, it's replacement). This is a big -ve.
