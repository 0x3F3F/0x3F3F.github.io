title: RSS Feed Readers Part II - Rawdog
category: linux
tags: [ 'RSS' ]
---

I've recently been playing around with feedreaders, and how I get my data from the web.  After playing around with [FreshRss](FreshRSS.html) 
I went back to tinkering around with [Rawdog](https://offog.org/code/rawdog/) which presents the data as a river-of-news, in a stylish web 1.0 format.

The output of the tool is a single html page that contains all of the articles in date order, with no method to mark items as read/unread.  This may
sound like a -ve, though I have an idea that if I can't get though all teh article to read in one day, then I'm suffering from information overload 
and it may force me to take action.

### Setup

This was quite strightforward, basically install and then add feeds into the config file.  There are many settings in there which can be tweaked. 
To run, I just execute:

	rawdog -uvw

This outputs an html file, which can then be copied only my local nginx server I had set up.  This process would probably be scripted, amd then put 
on a CRON. 

The output looks something like this:

![Rawdog](/img/2017/20171125_rawdog.jpg)

### Plugins
 
The tool has many plug-ins that allow the feed to be tailored to your taste.  Stuff like applying filters to disregard articles containing certain 
words.  Group by feeed instead of date. Execute commands before/after fetching feeds.  The plug-ins are written in python and quite understandable 
and API well documented, so I could write my own if I think I need a custom action.

One plugin I was playing around with filtered articles.  It worked well, all I had to do was update the config file as follows:

```conf
feed 3h https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ 
	filter hide ; show title "(i?)xperience #" ; hide title "est of" ; hide summary "(i?)comedian" 
```

### Pros

- Written in python
- Highly configurable and well documented
- Many plugins exist already. 
- Can output xml for another reader ie Radwog for filtering etc / FreshRss for display.
- Can output single html with all feeds in it, no need to go to sites.

### Cons

- Dated look
- Doesn't track read/unread items 


I'll probably keep playing around with this, though not sure I'll use it.
