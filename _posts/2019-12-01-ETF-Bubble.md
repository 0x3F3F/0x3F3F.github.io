The main argument for [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) is their **low 
cost fees**.  While an active manager might charge 1.5% (plus much more in hidden fees), a similar 
ETF could charge 0.5% or less.  All else being equal, this 1% saving could compound over time to 
correspond to a final investment pot of 50% more compared to an active fund.  So...

## Why I Don't Like ETFs

Traditionally, the market consisted of rational players making **risk-reward decisions** as
when to buy or sell a stock.  This led to a somewhat efficient market, with shares trading
at their 'correct price'.

With the advent of indexing, the pendulum started to swing and investors instead stopped
making risk reward decisions and only decided to 'buy the index'.  As the proportion of
people indexing has grown, this has led to **distortions in the market**.  

As waves of money enter the market, expensive shares become more expensive as they are
blindly bought according to their weighting in the index.  The gains become self
sustaining as more money enters and shares are driven to unimaginable highs.  Large
ex-growth companies now trade with 25+ PEs.

It's my opinion that in these distortions lies opportunity.  The **market has bifurcated** 
with shares that lie outside the indexes (or with lower weightings) being left behind 
and not bid-up like the larger ETF constituents.  Steve Bregman classified this bifurcated 
market as ["the ETF Divide"](https://horizonkinetics.com/wp-content/uploads/Grants_On-The-ETF-Divide.pdf).

When the pendulum swings back, the overvalued stocks held within ETFs could fall significantly 
and the undervalued stocks that were left behind outperform.  Active investors may once again have 
their day in the sun.


## A Closer Look

### Suspicious PEs

Steven Bregman [details the calculation](https://youtu.be/xpk3triMLZQ?t=1325) of the PE Ratio 
for the NASDAQ.  High PEs & -ve PEs are excluded from the calculation,  then the calculation 
is performed using a 'Weighting Harmonic mean'.  This calculation is somewhat different to 
an average (or weighted average), instead it involves the summation of the reciprocals.
Performing all these actions makes the PE come to at around 28 rather than 56 (WTF!).

This slight of hand does raise the prospect of what other 'funnies' there are, under-the-hood.


### Float Adjusted

Indices have been changed to lower the weightings of holdings in proportion to insider
ownership. This 'float adjusted' weighting  methodology improves the scalability of the
ETF, though likely not the performance of the fund - given that stocks with high insider
ownership are said to return up to 4% more per annum!

As the insiders sell their shares, presumably as they've lost confidence in the company,
the ETFs (a natural buyer) can step in and increase their weighting.  This is precisely the 
opposite action any rational investor would take.


### Diversification (Lack Thereof)

Due to the amount of funds entering ETFs, the indexes are forced to give larger companies higher 
weightings in the indices, which is **sub optimal**.  Many companies don't have sufficient
liquidity and can't be included, that is not enough shares are traded to handle large inflows 
of ETF cash.

Worse still, due to this **liquidity constraint**, they often include companies in the indices where	
they might not belong - Mr Bregman gives the example of Exxon Mobile being 25% of the iShares 
U.S. Energy ETF, 22% of the Vanguard Energy ETF, Its in  Dividend Growth and Deep Value Indices.  
It is in the USA Quality Factor ETF and in the Weak Dollar U.S. Equity ETF. He states "Get this: 
Itâ€™s both a Momentum Tilt stock and a Low Volatility stock."

As well as having the same stocks in multiple (seemingly unrelated) ETFs, the fact that a handful 
of stocks in each index account for the majority of the funds suggests diversification may not be 
as good as advertised.



## Conclusion

> You Need to search for securities that are outside the ETF flow of funds, that are idiosyncratic in their behaviour. They might do well, or might do poorly, but not for the same reasons the rest of the market does well/poorly. 

As everyone and their dog is indexing these days, my gut instinct is to do exactly the opposite - 
selecting active funds that focus on equities that are outside the indexes, with a bias to small cap.
