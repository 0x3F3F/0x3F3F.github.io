## Commentary

As can be seen from the allocation pie chart, the majority of the portfolio remains in cash and
very few purchases were made since the [last review]({% post_url 2018-05-08-Portfolio-Review %}).  

Overall performance was **-2%**, behind the `RPI+3%` benchmark (6%), but better than the `FTSEAS-TR` (-9%) 
and with much less volatility.  As I'm mainly uninvested, I'm not paying 
too much attention to the performance figures at the moment (Poor excuse #1)

The pull back in Oct/Nov didn't quite get into the area where I'd start accumulating,
though not far off.  In retrospect, with the `GBP` performance I should have started drip 
feeding in, but missed the opportunity for now.

The real activity in the portfolio came about in the management of the cash balances,
following my realisation that I was over exposed to `GBP` with the chaotic Brexit
transition.  The steps taken were documented in my [Portfolio Liquidity]({% post_url 2018-12-05-Liquidity %}) 
post, they look to have been a good move as I'm currently sitting on a small profit as a result 
(Not reflected in performance figures!).

I'm still contemplating what my final portfolio weightings will be.  The plan is to overweight the 
Multi Asset portfolio which will form the core and underweight the Growth portfolio which will be much 
more volatile but, er, growthy-er. 


### Multi Asset Portfolio

The Multi Asset portfolio had a couple of transactions, adding to a defensive fund and is
around 2/3rds invested (I'll probably re-jig portfolio weightings, so maybe less).  The 
remaining funds I'd like to add are slightly less defensive so I'm planning to accumulate on 
general market weakness.

The portfolio returned -3%, underperforming `RPI+3%` (6%)  but outperforming `FTSEAS-TR` (-9%) and with less 
much less volatility.  In a bear market, which I think we're in, I'd expect underperformance against the RPI 
measure and so I'm not too disappointed with the result (Poor excuse #2).


### Growth Portfolio

As can be seen above, I have renamed this from Thematic Growth and reworded the investment objective and 
methodology.  This now sets out a clear objective for what I'm trying to achieve and how I'm going to go 
about it.

I removed the cash component from the portfolio for the full year as I didn't see the point of holding it 
separate to my other 'Liquidity' holding. It now contains 100% precious metals, which the performance reflects.  

I have identified several secular trends which I'll expand on at some point in the future.  I have yet to 
decide on the final weightings, but know that there'll be a significant overweight to population growth 
in developing markets.



## Conclusion / Outlook

As I mentioned above, I suspect we're in a bear market.  The recent S&P price action appears to confirm this, 
as does inverted yield curves, Nasdaq down 20+%, Oil price fall etc.  The question is therefore, how far will 
we fall?  I have no idea, but here's an interesting chart :

> "The biggest mistake bears make is becoming bullish too early."

I remember reading that if stocks were to fall 90% and you waited till 80% before buying, then you'd still lose 
50% of your money.  This sums things up nicely, and I'll likely fall into this category.  I think the only way 
round it is to average in and accept there'll be losses.  The hard part is deciding when to start and over what 
time period. 

Brexit (or `GBP` performance) also adds an additional complication.  The worry is I feel forced take a position to 
avoid a 10% currency hit, only to then take a 40% equity hit. I'm going to try and not do that.

To summarise: I'm in no rush to invest in a market that I'm wary of, and have no clear plan other than to average 
in.  I'm vaguely thinking of waiting for a 20-30% drop before averaging in, which would correspond to the 2016 level 
from where the index took off in what looks like a blow-off top.  Saying that, things do tend to overshoot.
