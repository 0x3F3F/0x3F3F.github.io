## Commentary

Overall performance was **-1%**, behind both the `RPI+3%` (6%), and the `FTSEAS-TR` (+19%) benchmarks.

Since the [last review]({% post_url 2019-01-01-2018_Portfolio-Review %}), my recession
forecast has not come to pass and shares have marched higher.  Given this, my defensive
positioning has meant that I have lagged both of my benchmarks.


## Multi Asset Portfolio

I am pleased with the performance of the multi asset portfolio with a return of **10%**.  As
can be seen above, over a 2 years view it's keeping pace with the `FTSEAS-TR` but with 
significantly less volatility.

During the year I sold out of one of the funds, **Ruffer Investment Company**, as its performance was 
poor during a period of market volatility.  The fund is no longer managed by Jonathan Ruffer and 
now has 3 managers, which is 2 too many.  As well as being expensive in TER terms, it also had 
multiple holding of other Ruffer funds which I suspect layered another level of hidden fees. Why 
pay for a Ruffer gold fund, when they could just buy gold?

I plan on adding to this portfolio this year.

## Growth Portfolio

During the course of the year, holdings in the Growth Portfolio were increased significantly, but 
performance was poor **losing 5%**.

Holdings of longer dated US Treasuries were moved into the portfolio as had made sizeable gains and 
I wanted to account for them in my portfolio.  Shorted dated Notes / Cash were kept separate.

Gold holdings were sold and replaced by silver which had lagged the gold price rise, with the Gold/Silver 
ratio around an historic high of 85.  I'm opting for Silver rather than  miners as the historical returns are 
excellent and doesn't have company specific risk, as detailed in my notes on the 
[Currency Debasement]({% post_url 2019-11-08-Secular-Trend-Currency-Debasement %}) trend.

As part of the [Electricity Demand]({% post_url 2019-11-15-Secular-Trend-Electricity-Demand %}) theme, 
a basket of **uranium companies** were purchased with a bias towards producers.  This resulted in a large 
loss, though a disciplined approach meant that funds were available to average in at lower prices.  The 
uranium market is currently blocked due to anticipated US regulations, but I am hopeful once this is 
resolved the market will rebound.  The longer the situation takes to resolve, the higher I suspect the 
uranium price will go.  The main risk is how much my holdings get diluted in the meantime.

A general commodity investment trust was added to the portfolio as part of my [Commodity Cycle]({% post_url 2019-11-28-Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle %}) theme.
I expect commodities would fall in a market correction, though as they're at 10 year lows I suspect 
they will be quick to rebound.  This fund has holdings in Shipping and Gold Miners, which I'm keen to 
get exposure to, holding these via a fund has capital gains advantages also.  The IT has a small cap 
focus and has underperformed other commodity funds, which I think have benefited from the 
[ETF Divide]({% post_url 2019-12-01-ETF-Bubble %}).

The Growth Portfolio is mainly exposed to real assets which should hold their value in an inflationary 
environment.  In a deflationary environment, hopefully real assets downside is limited as they are 
already at multi-year lows.  The holdings in long dated bonds / silver should hedge against deflation. 

I'm not going to add any meaningful equity exposure at the current level, though this does leave
the portfolio unbalanced.  The plan is to only 'bet' once the odds are clearly in my favour, and not 
feel obliged to make equity purchases to round off the portfolio.  I hope to get the opportunity to 
do so at some point in the coming year.


## Conclusion 

We're currently in the longest business cycle on record.  Under normal circumstances, a recession 
should be on its way, but I need to consider the possibility of government devaluing their 
currencies (maybe losing control or maybe in a controlled manner):

> "The down-cycle will be different than 2008 and 2000. The FED wont allow markets to adjust to reality, 
> because of its political mandate, so inflation will be the pressure valve that releases all the excess in the system..."

With the above in mind, I've started to reduce liquidity and purchase real assets that have not 
benefited from the last 10 years of asset price inflation.  In my opinion, A re-run of the 70s is not
unlikely.

Additionally, precious metal holdings are likely to be a safe place to be, if the Dutch central bank 
are to be believed:

> "Gold is the perfect piggy bank â€“ it's the anchor of trust for the financial system. If
> the system collapses, the gold stock can serve as a basis to build it up again"

Stocks are considered an inflation hedge too, however "In hyperinflation, stocks can underperform 
the rate of inflation immensely" :

There appears to be a rush by central banks to buy / repatriate their gold.  Poland would rather hold 
its gold in Warsaw and risk it being stolen by Russia, than keep it in London.  It seems the probability 
of some sort of restructuring is non-zero and deckchairs are being moved accordingly.
