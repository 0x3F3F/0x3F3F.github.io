## Commentary


Since the [last review]({% post_url 2019-01-01-2018_Portfolio-Review %}), stock markets
have been driven higher and my recession call was proved to be incorrect.  Given this, my defensive
positioning has meant that I have lagged both of my benchmarks.  

Although the performance has been a bit *meh*, I'm happy to maintain the positioning going forward which is 
fairly evenly balanced.  Here's my overall position, including holdings outside the two
portfolios:

<img style="border: 0;" src="/img/2020/20200102_Overview3.png" />

Overall performance was **-1%**, behind both the `RPI+3%` (6%), and the `FTSEAS-TR` (+19%) benchmarks.

## Multi Asset Portfolio

I am pleased with the performance of the `Multi Asset Portfolio` with a return of **10%**.  As
can be seen above, over a 2 years view it's keeping pace with the `FTSEAS-TR` but with 
significantly less volatility.

During the year I sold out of one of the funds, the **Ruffer Investment Company**, as its performance was 
poor during a period of market volatility.  Not doing it's job.  The fund is no longer managed by Jonathan 
Ruffer and now has 3 managers. 2 too many.  As well as being expensive in TER terms, it also had 
multiple holdings of other Ruffer funds whose function,  I suspect, was to layer another level of **hidden 
fees**. Why pay for a Ruffer gold fund, when they could just buy gold?


## Growth Portfolio

During the course of the year, holdings in the `Growth Portfolio` were increased significantly but 
performance was poor, **losing 5%**.

Holdings of longer dated [US Treasuries]({% post_url 2018-12-05-Liquidity %}) were 
moved into the portfolio as had made decent gains and I wanted to account for them in my portfolio.  Shorter 
dated Notes / Cash were kept separate.

Gold holdings were sold and replaced by **silver** which had lagged the gold price rise, with the Gold/Silver 
ratio around an historic high of 85.  I prefer direct Silver holdings to the miners as the historical returns are 
excellent and it doesn't have company specific risk, as detailed in my notes on the 
[Currency Debasement]({% post_url 2019-11-08-Secular-Trend-Currency-Debasement %}) trend.

As part of the [Electricity Demand]({% post_url 2019-11-15-Secular-Trend-Electricity-Demand %}) trend, 
a basket of **uranium companies** were purchased with a bias towards **producers**.  This resulted in a large 
loss, though a disciplined approach meant that funds were available to average in at lower prices.  The 
uranium market is currently blocked due to anticipated US regulations, but I am hopeful once this is 
resolved the market will rebound.  The longer the situation takes to resolve, the higher I suspect the 
uranium price will go.  The **main risk is dilution**, though my overweight in producers should help 
mitigate against this.

A general **commodity investment trust** on a ~24% discount to NAV was added to the portfolio as part of my 
[Commodity Cycle]({% post_url 2019-11-28-Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle %}) theme.
I expect commodities may fall in a market correction, though as they're at 10 year lows I suspect 
they may be quick to rebound.  This fund has holdings in **Shipping** and **Gold Miners**, which I'm keen to 
gain exposure to, holding these via a fund also has capital gains advantages.  The IT has a small cap 
focus and has underperformed other commodity funds, which I think have benefited from the 
[ETF Divide]({% post_url 2019-12-01-ETF-Bubble %}).  The plan is to buy a larger (& cheaper) fund on 
general market weakness.

The `Growth Portfolio` is mainly exposed to **real assets** which should hold their value in an inflationary 
environment.  In a deflationary environment, the real assets' downside is limited as they are 
already at multi-year lows.  The holdings in long dated bonds / silver should hedge against deflation. 

I'm not going to add any meaningful equity exposure at the current level, though this does leave
the portfolio unbalanced.  The plan is to **only 'bet' once the odds are clearly in my favour**, and not 
feel obliged to make equity purchases to round off the portfolio.  I hope to get the opportunity to 
do so at some point in the coming year.


## Conclusion 

We're currently in the longest business cycle on record.  Under normal circumstances, a recession 
should be on its way, but I need to consider the possibility of that not happening (devaluing 
currencies either deliberately or accidentally):

> "The down-cycle will be different than 2008 and 2000. The FED wont allow markets to adjust to reality, 
> because of its political mandate, so **inflation will be the pressure valve** that releases all the excess in the system..."

With the above in mind, I've started to **reduce liquidity** and purchase **real assets** that have not 
benefited from the last 10 years of asset price inflation.  Word on the street is that :

> With money printing, eventually money leaks from yielding assets into non yielding assets such as commodities. 

**Precious metals** are likely to be a safe place to hide out, if the Dutch central bank are to be believed:

> "Gold is the perfect piggy bank â€“ it's the anchor of trust for the financial system. If
> the system collapses, the gold stock can serve as a basis to build it up again"

**Stocks** are often considered an inflation hedge too, however *"In hyperinflation, stocks can underperform 
the rate of inflation immensely"* :

There appears to be a rush by central banks to buy / repatriate their gold.  Poland would rather hold 
its gold in Warsaw and risk it being stolen by Russia, than keep it in London.  It seems the probability 
of some sort of restructuring is non-zero and deckchairs are being moved accordingly.

Overall, I'm happy with my idiosyncratic positioning in areas I consider to be either undervalued or 
defensive.  In not having exposure to the broader indices, my performance is likely to differ markedly to 
most other portfolios.  I had hoped that holding uncorrelated assets would smooth out my performance, but 
with a partially constructed Growth portfolio that hasn't been the case.

This year my investment allocation has not worked in my favour, but I'll continue to follow 
my own process and not run with the ETF herd.  I consider ETFs as a momentum play, fine when the general 
direction is positive, but could get messy on a pull-back as everyone rushes for the exit.
