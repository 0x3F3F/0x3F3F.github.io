### Creating my First Post

This is my first post, just testing it out.  Initial thoughts: The centre alignment looks bad on blog posts.

The site is hosted on Github and is powered by Jekyll.  The posts are constructed in markdown.  
In theory, it should all just work, but we'll see how it goes.

Not sure how often I'll post, probably very infrequently and it's likely to be tech or finance related.

#### Format tests

Here is an `inline` and a list:

- one
- two
- three

indentation:

    one
    two 
    three
  
  page
  ---
  separator
  
  And a (link)[www.iainbenson.com] back to mainpage. Hmm, need to think of some more markdown...
