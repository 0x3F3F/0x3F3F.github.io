This is my first post, just testing it out.  Initial thoughts: Front page looks good, but the centre alignment looks bad on individual blog posts (update: sort of fixed).

The site is hosted on Github and is powered by Jekyll.  To set up, I created a `USER.github.io` repository with a fork of [personal-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) and aded a `CNAME` file in the root.  Other than that, I just needed to then create `CNAME` and `A` records for my domain at the registrar.  I'll probably hack about with that the a bit.

The posts are constructed in markdown, which should be great.  I've put some tests below to see how stuff renders.  In theory, it should all just work, but we'll see how it goes.

Not sure how often I'll post, probably very infrequently and it's likely to be tech or finance related.

#### Markdown Format Tests

Here is an `inline` and a list:

- one
- two
- three

Hmm, don't like the centre justification there.  Lets try indentation:

    one
    two 
    three
  
page separator

Hmm, need to think of some more markdown that I might want to use...
