So, my old linux machine seem to have died on me - not booting for some reason.  I could probably fix it with a bootable usb, except the keyboard is broke(and can't get to boot menu).  Maybe come back to it. 

The upshot of this is that I decuded I should try and get my config files and scripts off of it, and put them under version control using git.  Although the machine didn't boot to i3 desktop, it did boot to the command line and so I could mount a usb and copy the files off of it.

The dotfiles are checked into a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/0x3F3F/dotfiles) on github.  I'll use stow to setup the symlinks, via some scripts that will give dlightly different setup depending on whether it's on my Raspberry Pi or on my Linux machines.

My random scripts from the bin directory are checked into a [scripts repo](https://github.com/0x3F3F/Scripts). Pretty standard stuff, though guess it gives an idea of my setup / workflow.
