## Investment Thesis


Following the Virus / stock market fall, the actions of the governments to expand their balance sheets 
has only re-enforced my view on inflation. I was surprised to find that, as an inflation hedge, the energy 
sector has outperformed both industrial and precious metals.

The 2010's have been described as the lost decade for energy, with the sector gaining only 6% v's 180% 
for the benchmark.  The S&P 500 sector weighting slipped to **<5% down from >15%**.  Will this mean revert?

Recent falls will have made the above chart even more extreme. As a result, many companies are going
bankrupt and oil majors significantly cutting back spending.  This appears to be a perfect setup for 
future shortages which the following (old) chart demonstrates:

Energy appears to be the most asymmetric way to play my view on higher inflation.  After 10 years of 
underperformance, downside looks limited and there appear to be reasonable catalysis for decent upside.

## Method 

I've previously invested in smaller oil companies, and would prefer to avoid the volatility / risks 
involved with them.  I'll look to play this by investing in oil majors and 
<a href="https://www.iainbenson.com/investment/2019/11/28/Secular-Trend-Commodity-Cycle.html#royalty-companies">royalty companies</a>, 
some of which have fallen significantly => as less downside - great risk/reward.  In my view, they offer 
an opportunity to double or more in value and pay an ongoing dividend.
