## Investment Thesis


As I have general inflation expectations in the coming years, the Oil and Gas sector is one which is of 
great interest.  I was surprised to find that, as an inflation hedge, the energy sector has outperformed
both industrial and precious metals:

The 2010's have been described as the lost decade for energy, with the sector gaining only 6% v's 180% 
for the benchmark.  The S&P 500 sector weighting slipped to **<5% down from >15%**.  Will this mean revert?

Recent falls will have made the above chart even more extreme. As a result, many companies are going
bankrupt and oil majors significantly cutting back spending.  This appears to be a perfect setup for 
future shortages, as I don't see oil usage decreasing to the scale some might expect.

I've previously invested in smaller oil companies, and would prefer to avoid the volatility / risks 
involved with them.  I'll look to play this by investing in oil majors, some of which have fallen 
over 50%, as less downside.  In my view, they offer an opportunity to double or more in value and pay an
ongoing dividend.
